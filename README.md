# OOPS Java Projects 🚀

This repository contains my Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) lab projects implemented using Java as part of my B.E CSE coursework.

---

## 📚 About

These projects demonstrate practical implementation of core OOPS concepts such as:

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Interfaces
- Abstract Classes
- Constructor Overloading
- Composition (HAS-A relationship)
- ArrayList
- Arrays of Objects

All applications are console-based and menu-driven.
